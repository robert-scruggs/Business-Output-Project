#when someone travels to one of these websites, they can choose from any of these endpoints

# first column: which endpoint you are working on
# second column: which method from views you will use

#think of these mfs like rooms!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#create the rooms and then run a function to tell system what to show and do in room
